INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
see http://www.s3db.org/documentation for details

1. Download Source 
The latest release of S3DB can be found at http://www.s3db.org/download 

2. Unpack Source to a web accessible directory (directory at your webspace or below your web server DocumentRoot) further referred as installation directory 

You can use the zip file utility, for example WinZip, to unpack the S3DB zip file.


3. Point your browser to the url where you installed S3DB, for example: http://localhost/s3db and follow the instructions to set up the S3DB. You DO NOT need to create a database first - you DO need to make sure a database does not exist that has the same name you are trying to create (default is s3db).

4. Advanced users: If you have never intalled s3db before, chances are you do not have a database called s3db. In this case, and if you have not set a password for your MySQL root user, you can go ahead and finish your installation without advanced options.

Nevertheless, since MySQL and PostgresSQL work differently in terms of user privileges, if you are using PortgresSQL or you have defined a password for your MySQL root user, you will need to specify this user's username and password in the configuration page. 

NOTICE: If you are a linux user, remember that the apache user will need to have read/write privileges in the s3db directory. Unless this is enabled, s3db will not function properly.

NOTICE: 
Enable the following php modules (if not already enabled):
php_curl
php_mysql and php_mysqli  (or php_pgsql, in case you are using postgresSQL)
php_sockets
	    
And the following apache modules
mod_rewrite (you can find the Rewrite Rules file, .htaccess, under /uri - move this file to the root of s3db if you want to be able to call perform short URI queries).

NOTICE:
Please install S3DB src and database in the same server; if you wish to use a different host, please indicate so AFTER installation and edit the config.inc.php file accordingly.
