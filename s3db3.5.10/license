Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "S3DB Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction to use, copy or distribute but NOT to modify or merge with other software. Since this S3DB software is primarily a web service, the restriction to merge is understood as pertaining to server-side functions. That is, the S3DB software can be used by any client side application, on which the authors place no such restriction.

This S3DB Software is a research prototype experimenting with the S3DB data representation and information management architecture. Alternative architectures should be pursued by independent code development efforts - as is the case of the production version of the S3DB software (not this one) which does not reuse components of this S3DB software. The purpose of the restriction on modification is to prevent prototypical intermediate versions of the S3DB software such as this one, which include experimental features that the authors may not want to include in the final software, from leading or supporting the development of alternative architectures that do not fit the S3DB framework. In a nutshell, the restriction on modification seeks to prevent code forking.
